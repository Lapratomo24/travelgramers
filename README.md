Welcome to TravelGramers!

Traveling is a wonderful experience. It is one of the best ways to forget the hustle and bustle of a stress-filled life in the city. Through travels, you can discover not only new places, but also new cultures, cuisines, and ways of life. You experience lots of new things by visiting places you have never been to, and you may create new bonds with people you have never met before. Each of this moment is a memory waiting to be told. 

TravelGramers is a blog created for one purpose: for travelgoers to tell their tales. You can share your most unique and interesting travel stories with others. After creating your blog account, you will be able to create a blog post and share your travel experience. Oh, and don't forget to include your best photo!

The creation of this blog is intended to showcase a Full-Stack web application in a real-world context using an MVC framework and related technologies. Heroku is used to deploy the application on a webpage.

## Objective

TravelGramers is a travel blog that is intended to display a user's travel experience(s) as a post that others can see and interact with. Users can create an account to be able to create a new post on the blog. Logged-in users can click the like button on each post as well as leave comments to interact with one another. They will also be able to update their post(s) to add more information, or they can choose to delete them entirely should they feel like doing so.

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
